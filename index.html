            <p>RentMyRide is a car rental website that allows renters and loaners to register their accounts. Loaners are able to add their cars and they get stored 
                in the database. The renters are then able to rent these cars on the dates that are available. Moreover, the website includes functionalities such as 
                loaners and renters being able to see the histories of their cars, loaners being able to edit their car information, view their live listings, choose 
                a premium wash and detail plan, etc. The website was designed in a way that it has the most user-friendly interface. We minimized typing inputs and 
                instead implemented drop-down menus, scrolling bars, and date selection calendars. Furthermore, the website has background videos of supercars driving 
                around which further enhances the aesthetics and visuals.

                they can have access to all the resources. Once logged in the user is able to search for any course and if it is not available on the website, the 
                user can put in a request to get it added. When a user searches for a course, he is able to view all the professors and tutors. He can get more 
                information about the individual by clicking on their name. Moreover, the user can see all the comments posted by other students which helps him 
                understand the course more and choose the best professor. The user is also able to comment by filling out a comment section form which is then 
                instantly displayed on the website. Finally, a student can fill out a form to become a tutor, which then goes to the admins and they can put the 
                tutor online after reviewing his filled-out profile form. Once online, the users of the website will then be able to contact that particular tutor 
                in order to avail his services.

                Once a user is logged in, he is prompted to pay a membership fee that allows access to specifically reserved movies. The user can then search
                for different movies, choose a cinema location, select a show time, and book seats. After booking, the user is shown a confirmation and his cancellation
                codes for the seats. If he wants to cancel any seats, he may enter the code and get a refund. The seat will be up for grabs by any other user who wants to
                book it. Moreover, a single seat can not be booked by multiple users to avoid conflict. This app does not have a customized front end as only the backend
                functionalities were required at that time.
